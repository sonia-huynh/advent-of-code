<br>

⚒️ **Day 1: Trebuchet?!** ⚒️

- **Part 2:** Learnt how to map new items over old ones using replaceAll() and a for...loop

🧊 **Day 2: Cube Conundrum** 🧊

- **Part 1:** I learnt how to destructure an array that has been created from a string split
- **Part 2:** Learnt that if I want to compare values and reassign a variable, I need to have a global variable to compare to the local one because I can't just reassign the local one
