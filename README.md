# advent-of-code-2023

Starting the advent of code 2023 challenge on Tuesday 4 June 2024! Let's gooo!!!

See below for what I have learnt on this journey:

Day 1: Trebuchet?!

- Part 1: Understanding how to use += correctly and getting used to the .filter() method
- Part 2: Learnt how to map new items over old ones using replaceAll() and a for...loop

Day 2: Cube Conundrum

- Part 1: I learnt how to destructure an array that has been created from a string split
- Part 2: Learnt that if I ever want to compare values and reassign a variable, I need to have a global variable to compare to the local one because I can't just reassign the local one
